## :::WE ARE N64:::

JenniferHawk is a work in progress. This was the first program I wrote in Java (or in any language, mostly) 
so there are still a lot of baby programmer quirks that I'm working out. 

I make it public as a basic framework for others getting started with Twitch4J and anyone new to Twitch bots who wants to know 
how they might work if they wanted to make their own. But on that note, I take no responsibility for the quality of the code here
and I do not recommend that it be taken as an example of how to do most things. 

Everything I learn on other projects eventually makes it back to JenniferHawk. Feel free to do submit a PR to this project if you use
Jennifer and there's something you'd like to see done better.
